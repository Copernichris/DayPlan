# DayPlan

## Goal
The goal of this website was to create a planner using local storage and moment to display a current day and color code cards based on what time it is.

## Save
Contents of text areas can be saved. Saving sends the items to local storage meaning a user can refresh the page or reopen the page after closing the browswer. Information will remain until local storage is cleared.

## Color coding
Use of jquery and this allow for a more streamlined method of looping through ids, comparing its value to a current time, and assigning or removing classes based on wether the current time is less than, equal to, or more than the activity time.
